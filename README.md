# firstRepo
There are two ways you can get started with a git repository: initializing an empty repository, or cloning an existing repository. If *we wanted to make a* repository called test, we can either **clone my test repository, or** we could create an empty one from scratch. For example:


|type|description|
|:---:|----------|
|`numerics()`|real number|
|`interger()`|integer number|
|`factor()`  |categorical data|
|`character` |text data|
|`data.frame`|a data set|


Recreate a markdown file that has displays the following information (modify README.md). You may want to edit this on GitHub, as you can write markdown code and preview it interactively.
* numeric(): real numbers
* integer(): integer numbers
* factor(): categorical data
      * I don't usually like factors, but they do have their place. You'll almost always find character variables easier to work with.
* chatacter(): text data
* data.frame(): a data set
        *	Or you could use data_frame(). I like them better for reasons we will discuss later in the course.
